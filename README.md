# üÉü pri‚ô¶ate_p‚ô°ker üÉèÔ∏é

- Wanting to play poker but only have a computer and no playing cards?
- Having a slow day at work and in need of something to pass the time
  with your coworkers?
- Managing an entirely legal gambling ring and in need of a secure,
  private, and easy-to-use solution for running poker games?

If you answered "yes" to any of these rhetorical questions, then this project
is for you! Host and manage a poker game from the comfort of your computer
with **p**ri‚ô¶ate_**p**‚ô°ker (or **pp** for short)!

# Poker over `ssh`

One can host a server with the provided `Dockerfile` for the following
benefits:

- The server is ephemeral and more isolated from the host system
- Client binaries don't need to be distributed to users
- Server connections are managed by `ssh`
- Users are managed by the container's user space

Host and manage poker over `ssh` with the following commands:

1. Build the image:
   
   ```bash
   docker build -t poker .
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run --name poker -p $port:22 --rm poker
   ```

3. Create a user:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it poker sh ./bin/create_user.sh $username
   docker cp poker:/home/$username/.ssh/id_rsa $poker_ssh_key
   ```

   This creates a user in the container's user space and copies
   their private key to the host. Send the user their key so they
   can SSH into the server and start playing.

4. Users can SSH into the server and play:

   ```bash
   ssh -i $poker_ssh_key -p $port $username@$host
   ```

5. Delete a user:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it poker deluser --remove-home $username
   ```

6. Stop the server:

   ```bash
   docker stop poker
   ```

# Poker without Docker

The poker over `ssh` Docker image is < 40MB, but requires some additional
user management on the host's part. If you're playing a poker game in a
local or private network, and all your users are familiar with `cargo`,
it's less work to just use the poker binaries directly rather than using
Docker and `ssh`.

1. For the host, run the server binary:
   
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin pp_server -r -- --bind $host
   ```

2. For users, run the client binary:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin pp_client -r -- $username --connect $host
   ```

# Project structure

```bash

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pp_client       # Client binary source
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pp_server       # Server binary source
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ private_poker   # Library that the client and server use
```

# Non-goals

I use this project to learn Rust and to play poker with friends
and family. I'm probably disinterested in anything related to this
project that doesn't contribute to those goals. Specifically, the
following features are ommitted from this project and left as an
exercise to forkers:

- Server orchestration or scaling
- Persistent storage or backups of game data
- UIs beyond the TUI
